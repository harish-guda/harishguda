## Arizona State University

* SCM 551: Operations Planning and Execution - MBA Elective.
  - [Syllabus](/files/scm-551-syllabus.PDF)
  - I run a series of simulation activities (e.g., the Littlefield Technologies Simulation at the tactical and operational Levels, the Supply Chain Simulation at the regional and the global level, the beer distribution game, etc.) -- the goal of each simulation involves the students to build an R script (or Excel, if students are not enrolled in Analytics) that aids them in decision-making. 

* SCM 502: Operations and Supply Chain Management - MBA Core.
  - [Syllabus](/files/syllabus-scm-502.PDF)
  - I plan to maintain an independent [repository](https://harish-guda.github.io/scm-502) of past content -- this is work-in-progress. Students may use this at their own discretion.

## University of Texas at Dallas

* OPRE 3310: Introduction to Operations Management - BS (BA) Core.
