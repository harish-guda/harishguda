Hello all!

This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title *Om Vighnaraja* (instead of a *Hello World*). My hope is to keep y'all updated with content regularly. 

One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully: For example, 
$$\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})} = \frac{\hat{\theta}}{w}$$
has a unique solution for $\hat{\theta} \in [0,1]$. 

Thank you.
