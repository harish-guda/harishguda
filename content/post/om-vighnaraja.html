<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title <em>Om Vighnaraja</em> (instead of a <em>Hello World</em>). My hope is to keep yâ€™all updated with content regularly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully: For example,
<span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})} = \frac{\hat{\theta}}{w}\]</span>
has a unique solution for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} \in [0,1]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
