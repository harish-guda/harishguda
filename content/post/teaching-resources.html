<p>I am writing this post as I complete my first quarter of teaching as an Assistant Professor. I taught the core Operations and Supply Chain Management to FT MBAs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As I went through this process, I realized that many new instructors might have similar needs in the various courses they teach. For example, a template for a syllabus, an exam, a homework, or even PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>While there was an abundance of such resources online, it is hard for a user to try out everything to weed out the bad ones from the good ones. I indulged in this costly search, so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Here are some of these resources (see Github <a href="https://github.com/harish-guda/teaching-resources">repo</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exam/Homework Template (LaTeX): While there are many LaTeX templates for exams, I liked this particular template (borrowed and modified from Philip Hirschhorn; Thank you, Philip!). Two features are the points per question calculated on the front page, and the bonus questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruction Slides Template (PowerPoint): If you are not teaching a technical (i.e., notation-intensive) course, and therefore unlikely to use Beamer, I highly recommend PowerPoint. I try to minimize white space on the top, bottom, left and right margins. Many students have commented that the template I use is extremely readable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro-tip: I upload two versions of slides for every lecture to the students’ LMS portal (e.g., ASU uses Canvas) while teaching:
<ul>
<li>A “before-class” version and</li>
<li>an “after-class” version.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I intentionally leave whitespaces/blanks to key answers/issues/aspects in the before-class version. This allows me to have a discussion with my students. I then fill these blanks up during instruction<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and then upload the after-class version.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Syllabus Template (LaTeX): Each department/institution has unique requirements for a syllabus. I provide a general-purpose template for a syllabus. Please add any required content to the template.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro-tip: I recommend you to list the schedule for your course <em>not</em> by date but by a session index (e.g., session 1, 2, etc.).</li>
<li>This allows you to make minimal adjustments over multiple terms if the core content remains the same. For instance, I plan to adjust the case studies in my course over the next few years but the key topics remain the same.</li>
</ul></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>My students were absolute gems and I wish every instructor gets to teach the type of students I taught last quarter.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I fill the blanks by writing on my slides. I use a Microsoft Surface Book, which, like most touchscreen laptops allows users to write on slides using a stylus. If you are a new instructor and planning on purchasing a laptop for long-term use, I highly recommend a Surface Book. There’s an accompanying warranty of two years (at a small premium) which is also something I recommend.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
