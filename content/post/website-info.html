<p>I have always wanted to build attractive websites and still have a lot of control on the various facets of the website. I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked I am not a professional with regards to web-development. Besides, my needs were minimal. With little knowledge on this topic, I did what everyone else does â€“ dive straight into it.</p>
<p>I am quite comfortable with R, and when Yihui Xie and co-authors came out with the book on <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, I wasted no time. However, it can be still quite difficult with no experience on HTML, or prior exposure to CSS (which is me!). Some useful tutorials are from <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/#in-github">Alison Hill</a> (who is a co-author on the textbook) and <a href="https://andreaczhang.rbind.io/post/my-1st-blogpost/">Chi Zhang</a>.</p>
<p>I had owned a custom domain (bought from Google Domains), and continued as the tutorials suggested. I hope it works for you if you plan to use it too.</p>
