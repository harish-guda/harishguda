I am a PhD student in Management Science at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://jindal.utdallas.edu). I am advised by [Milind Dawande](https://utdallas.edu/~milind) and [Ganesh Janakiraman](https://utdallas.edu/~ganesh). My broad interests are in understanding emerging business models that transform the way we consume goods and services and the challenges therein. I help solve these problems, both using analytical models, and using data-driven methods. My academic training and coursework are in the areas of Optimization, Game Theory and Information Economics, Statistics, Econometrics and Machine Learning.
