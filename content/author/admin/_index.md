I am a 6th year PhD student in Management Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am advised by Milind Dawande and Ganesh Janakiraman. My broad interests are in understanding emerging business models that change the way we consume goods and services and the associated challenges they create. I am trained in Optimization, Game Theory, and Econometrics.
