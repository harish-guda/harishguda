      <description>I am writing this post as I complete my first quarter of teaching as an Assistant Professor. I taught the core Operations and Supply Chain Management to FT MBAs.1 As I went through this process, I realized that many new instructors might have similar needs in the various courses they teach. For example, a template for a syllabus, an exam, a homework, or even PowerPoint presentations.
While there was an abundance of such resources online, it is hard for a user to try out everything to weed out the bad ones from the good ones.</description>
