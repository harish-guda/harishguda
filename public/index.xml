      <title>Some Information on Creating Websites with R</title>

      <description>Update: Much of this information is available in detail at multiple places, including:
The Little Dataset,Official Blogdown E-Book,Alison Hill (who is a co-author on the textbook),among others.
I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked. I am quite comfortable with R, and when Yihui Xie and co-authors came out with the book on blogdown, I decided to try it. However, it can be still quite difficult with no experience to HTML, or prior exposure to CSS.</description>

      <description>Hello all!
This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title Om Vighnaraja (instead of a Hello World). My hope is to keep yâ€™all updated with content regularly.
One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully. For example,
Fix \(d, w \in [0, 1]\). The indifferent agent \(\hat{\theta} \in [0, 1]\) can be obtained by the following equation:\[w\Bigg(\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})}\Bigg) - \hat{\theta} = 0.</description>
