      <title>Some Information on Creating Websites with R</title>

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to build attractive websites and still have a lot of control on the various facets of the website. I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked I am not a professional with regards to web-development. Besides, my needs were minimal. With little knowledge on this topic, I did what everyone else does – dive straight into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite comfortable with R, and when Yihui Xie and co-authors came out with the book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;, I wasted no time. However, it can be still quite difficult with no experience on HTML, or prior exposure to CSS (which is me!). Some useful tutorials are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/#in-github&#34;&gt;Alison Hill&lt;/a&gt; (who is a co-author on the textbook) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://andreaczhang.rbind.io/post/my-1st-blogpost/&#34;&gt;Chi Zhang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had owned a custom domain (bought from Google Domains), and continued as the tutorials suggested. I hope it works for you if you plan to use it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title &lt;em&gt;Om Vighnaraja&lt;/em&gt; (instead of a &lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt;). My hope is to keep y’all updated with content regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
