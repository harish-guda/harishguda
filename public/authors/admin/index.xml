      <description>I am a PhD student in Management Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am advised by Milind Dawande and Ganesh Janakiraman. My broad interests are in understanding emerging business models that transform the way we consume goods and services and the challenges therein. I help solve these problems, both using analytical models, and using data-driven methods. My academic training and coursework are in the areas of Optimization, Game Theory and Information Economics, Statistics, Econometrics and Machine Learning.</description>
